# Moview Review Emotion Checker
This project involves creating a web application using Streamlit for analyzing movie reviews based on emotions expressed in the text. 
It utilizes a machine learning model (loaded from "emotion_classifier_pipe_lr.pkl") to predict emotions such as anger, disgust, fear, happiness, joy, sadness, neutrality, surprise, and shame from movie reviews. 
Users can input their movie reviews, and the application displays the predicted emotion along with confidence scores. 
Additionally, it includes a history section to track past analysis
